# Spam_Classification_NLP_Using_ML_Models
This project classifies emails or messages as spam or ham using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models. The text data is preprocessed, tokenized, and transformed into features, which are then used to train ML models such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest to accurately detect spam.
